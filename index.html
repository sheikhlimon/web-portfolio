            <h3>World-class Professional Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Well, technically I'm in the internet world for a long time. I have been researching a lot. I have also learned a lot of things. Through Google search engine I have learned many things. But from the beginning something piqued my interest which was to learn programming. To fulfil that desire I have started to learn Web Development and as I become more experienced I will dive into the world of programming.</p>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>I already learned the basic of HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can also now teach some of my friends how to code. Once I'm finished with the basics I begin to master the advanced topic of these languages. Once I master them I will be able to create full fledged websites.</p>
